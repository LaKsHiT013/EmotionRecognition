# Emotion Recognition

# Overview
This repository contains code for a hybrid model utilizing ResNet and VGG16 architectures for emotion recognition from facial images. Additionally, it includes real-time emotion recognition using OpenCV.

# Introduction
Emotion recognition is a crucial task in various fields such as human-computer interaction, healthcare, and market research. This repository offers a solution leveraging deep learning models to accurately identify emotions from facial images.

# Hybrid Model
The hybrid model combines the power of two popular convolutional neural network architectures: ResNet and VGG16. By leveraging the strengths of both models, we aim to enhance the accuracy and robustness of emotion recognition. The final predictions are obtained by averaging the predictions of both models.



# Usage

## Hybrid Model Training
The training notebooks for both ResNet and VGG16 models are provided in this repository. You can train the models on your dataset by following the instructions in the respective notebooks.

## Real-time Emotion Recognition
To run the real-time emotion recognition script, follow these steps:

-> Ensure all dependencies are installed.
-> Download the pre-trained ResNet and VGG16 models and place them in the appropriate directories.
Run the provided real-time emotion recognition script (real_time_emotion_recognition.py).
